Ghemical Force Field (ghemical)
=============================

The Ghemical force field matches an existing open source package,
which provided a force field for geometry optimization and molecular
dynamics similar to the Tripos-5.2 force field method (which is
proprietary). It performs acceptably on providing geometries of
organic-like molecules.

We recommend use of either the :ref:`Generalized_Amber_Force_Field` or
:ref:`MMFF94_Force_Field` for organic molecules, and the
:ref:`Universal_Force_Field` for other types of molecules.

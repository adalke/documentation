.. _PubChem_format:

PubChem format (pc)
===================

**An XML format containing information on PubChem entries.**

`PubChem <http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ is a freely-available
database of chemical compounds and their properties.

OpenBabel only extracts the chemical structure information, and the
potentially large amount of other information is currently ignored.
The format seems to handle multiple conformers, but only one is read
(this needs testing).



.. note:: This is a read-only format.

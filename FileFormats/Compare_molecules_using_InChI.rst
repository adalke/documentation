Compare molecules using InChI (k)
=================================

**A utility format that allows you to compare molecules using their InChIs**

The first molecule is compared with the rest, e.g.::

  babel first.smi second.mol third.cml -ok

This is the same as using ``-oinchi -xet`` and can take the same options as InChI format
(see :ref:`InChI_format`).


.. note:: This is a write-only format.

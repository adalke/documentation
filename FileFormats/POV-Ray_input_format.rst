POV-Ray input format (pov)
==========================

**Generate an input file for the open source POV-Ray ray tracer.**


The POV-Ray file generated by Open Babel should be considered a starting
point for the user to create a rendered image of a molecule. Although care
is taken to center the camera on the molecule, the user will probably want
to adjust the viewpoint, change the lighting, textures, etc.

The file :file:`babel_povray3.inc` is required to render the povray file
generated by Open Babel. This file is included in the Open Babel
distribution, and it should be copied into the same directory as the
:file:`.pov` file before rendering. By editing the settings in
:file:`babel_povray3.inc` it is possible to tune the appearance
of the molecule.

For example, the image below was generated by rendering the output from the
following command after setting the reflection of non-metal atoms to 0
(line 121 in :file:`babel_povray3.inc`)::

  obabel -:"CC(=O)Cl acid chloride" --gen3d -O chloride.pov -xc -xf -xs -m SPF

Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

-c  *Add a black and white checkerboard*
-f  *Add a mirror sphere*
-m <model-type>  *BAS (ball-and-stick), SPF (space-fill) or CST (capped sticks)*

    The default option is ball-and-stick. To choose space-fill, you would use
    the following command line::
 
      obabel aspirin.mol -O aspirin.pov -xm SPF
 
-s  *Add a sky (with clouds)*
-t  *Use transparent textures*

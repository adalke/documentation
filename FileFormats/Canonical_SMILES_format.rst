Canonical SMILES format (can)
=============================

**A canonical form of the SMILES linear text format**

The SMILES format is a linear text format which can describe the
connectivity and chirality of a molecule. Canonical SMILES gives a single
'canonical' form for any particular molecule.



Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

-a  *Output atomclass like [C:2], if available*
-h  *Output explicit hydrogens as such*
-i  *Do not include isotopic or chiral markings*
-n  *No molecule name*
-r  *Radicals lower case eg ethyl is Cc*
-t  *Molecule name only*


Comments
~~~~~~~~
See also, the "regular" SMILES format, which results in faster
output, since no canonical numbering is performed.

Canonical SMILES format (can)
=============================

**A canonical form of the SMILES linear text format**

The SMILES format is a linear text format which can describe the
connectivity and chirality of a molecule. Canonical SMILES gives a single
'canonical' form for any particular molecule.

Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cmdoption:: a

  Output atomclass like [C:2], if available

.. cmdoption:: h

  Output explicit hydrogens as such

.. cmdoption:: i

  Do not include isotopic or chiral markings

.. cmdoption:: n

  No molecule name

.. cmdoption:: r

  Radicals lower case eg ethyl is Cc

.. cmdoption:: t

  Molecule name only
Comments
~~~~~~~~
See also, the "regular" SMILES format, which results in faster
output, since no canonical numbering is performed.

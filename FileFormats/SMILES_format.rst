.. _SMILES_format:

SMILES format (smi, smiles)
===========================

**A linear text format which can describe the connectivity and chirality of a molecule**

OpenBabel implements the `OpenSMILES specification <http://opensmiles.org>`_.

It also implements an extension to this specification for radicals.

-a  *Output atomclass like [C:2], if available*
-c  *Output in canonical form*
-h  *Output explicit hydrogens as such*
-i  *Do not include isotopic or chiral markings*
-n  *No molecule name*
-r  *Radicals lower case eg ethyl is Cc*

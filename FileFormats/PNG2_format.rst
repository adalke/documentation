PNG2 format (png2)
==================

**2D depiction of a single molecule as a .png file**


The PNG2 format is used 'behind the scenes' by the :ref:`PNG format<PNG_2D_depiction>`
if generating image files, and the best way to use it is
actually through the PNG format. While it possible to generate
a :file:`.png` file directly using the PNG2 format as follows...::

  obabel -:"CC(=O)Cl" -opng2 -O mymol.png

...it is much better to generate it using the PNG format
as this allows you to embed a chemical structure in the
:file:`.png` file header which you can later extract::

  $ obabel -:"CC(=O)Cl" -O mymol.png -xO smi
  $ obabel mymol.png -osmi
  CC(=O)Cl

The PNG2 format uses the Cairo library to generate the
:file:`.png` files.
If Cairo was not found when Open Babel was compiled, then
this format will be unavailable. However, it will still be possible
to use the PNG format to read :file:`.png` files if they contain
embedded information.

Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

-p <pixels>  *image size, default 300*
-w <pixels>  *image width (or from image size)*
-h <pixels>  *image height (or from image size)*
-c <num>  *number of columns in table*
-r <num>  *number of rows in table*
-N <num>  *max number objects to be output*
-u  *no element-specific atom coloring*

    Use this option to produce a black and white diagram
-U  *do not use internally-specified color*

    e.g. atom color read from cml or generated by internal code
-C  *do not draw terminal C (and attached H) explicitly*

    The default is to draw all hetero atoms and terminal C explicitly,
    together with their attched hydrogens.
-a  *draw all carbon atoms*

    So propane would display as H3C-CH2-CH3
-d  *do not display molecule name*
-s  *use asymmetric double bonds*
-t  *use thicker lines*
-A  *display aliases, if present*

    This applies to structures which have an alternative, usually
    shorter, representation already present. This might have been input
    from an A or S superatom entry in an sd or mol file, or can be
    generated using the --genalias option. For example::
 
      obabel -:"c1cc(C=O)ccc1C(=O)O" -O out.png
             --genalias -xA
 
    would add a aliases COOH and CHO to represent the carboxyl and
    aldehyde groups and would display them as such in the svg diagram.
    The aliases which are recognized are in data/superatom.txt, which
    can be edited.

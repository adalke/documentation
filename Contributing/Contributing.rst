As a user
---------

Users can contribute by helping to answer questions on our mailing list, requesting features, promoting and citing OpenBabel everywhere they go, writing blog posts about OpenBabel, and most of all...by reporting bugs.

Please, please, please report bugs. We only fix bugs we know about but most users never tell us that something is wrong. This makes the OpenBabel fish very sad (if being out of water wasn't enough).

Either send an email to our `users mailing list <mailto://openbabel-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net>`_ or (better still) create an account on SourceForge and file a bug on our bug tracker.

As a developer
--------------

New developers are always very welcome. If you're interested in getting started, send an email to the developer list (`join here <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/openbabel-devel>`_) and I'm sure we can come up with a job for you to do.

For new and existing developers here are some useful resources:

- SourceForge `project page <http://www.sf.net/projects/openbabel>`_
- Development version `API documentation <http://openbabel.org/dev-api>`_ and `documentation bugs <http://openbabel.org/dev-api/docbuild.out>`_
- Nightly build and test `dashboard <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Open%20Babel>`_
- RSS feed for SVN commits at `CIA.vc <http://cia.vc/stats/project/OpenBabel>`_

Open Babel user documentation
=============================

The Open Babel user documentation is generated from the text files in this project.

The source files have extension ``.rst``, indicating reStructuredText, a simple markup language widely used in the Python community and becoming more generally popular due to Sphinx, the documentation system that we are using here.

Editing the docs
----------------

Before editing the docs, you need to create a Github account and send me (baoilleach) the account name. Then I will add you to the list of 'collaborators'.

Github provides previews of reST documentation, which makes it easy to edit the docs directly on the github website. Alternatively, you can check out the repository and edit it locally. Note that Windows users should set ``autocrlf=true`` as described in the Github tutorials.

Building the docs
-----------------

To build the docs yourself, you need to have Sphinx 1.0 installed. Ideally you would also have the doxylink extension installed, but if not, you will just be missing the hyperlinks to the Doxygen docs.

(1) To build the documentation, type ``make html`` or ``make latex``. 
(2) To correct errors in the generated HTML and LaTeX, type ``python FixHTML.py``.

Automatic generation
--------------------

The docs are automatically generated once an hour on the hour from the latest source. (Let me know if you want it more often)
